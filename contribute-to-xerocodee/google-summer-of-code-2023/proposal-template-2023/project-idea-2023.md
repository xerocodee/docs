# Project Idea 2023

**Title:  Full-Stack & Web-Focused workspace  ( user-friendly workflow )**

**Mentor(s):**  TBD

**Skills required/preferred:**

**Goal:**  To create a user-friendly interface that is easy to use, even for users with no programming experience. Users should be able to drag and drop custom UI components to different sections of the design page, allowing them to create unique and custom designs. The website builder should support four different frameworks, such as React, Next, Vue and Typescript to export the design code to the user's preferred framework, so they can continue to work on their project outside of the website builder.

**Sub-Goal:**&#x20;

* Create a search bar with functionality to search for projects and workspaces and the ability to create, clone and delete workspaces.
* Implement project customization features including theme selection, project settings, SEO features, database connectivity and API integration.&#x20;
* Integrate hosting providers and include features for social network tagging and Google Kit integration.

_Further features will be added to improve it further depending on the timeline_

**Project Duration:** 350 hours

**Difficulty:** Hard



**Title:  Workspace UI revamp and UX improvements**

**Mentor(s):**  TBD

**Skills required/preferred: UX Research, UI Design, Figma**

**Goal:**  Conversations in XeroCodee may be conducted in a variety of methods, but at this point, we want a scalable interface to assist users in optimising their everyday duties within the platform. The following enhancements might help users' workflow:

**Sub-Goal:**&#x20;

* Implement a unified and intuitive interface for managing the development process from design to deployment.&#x20;
* Include a feature to add custom fonts, navigation elements and various design elements such as text, media and forms.
* Allow for creation and editing of dropdown, navbar and other interactive elements.&#x20;
* Provide the ability to upload or add pre-defined assets including images and icons, and edit CSS and SCSS classes.

**Project Duration:** 350 hours

**Difficulty:** Medium to hard ( depending on chosen scope )

**Deliverables:** Improve the UX and UI of daily chores on a central software touch point.



**Title:  UIKit ReactJS, NextJS, VueJS & Typescript components**

**Mentor(s):**  TBD

**Skills required/preferred:** JavaScript/TypeScript, ReactJS, NextJS, VueJS, Webpack

**Goal:**  To build high-quality UI components, improve development efficiency and enhance compatibility and interoperability.

**Sub-Goal:**&#x20;

* Create a library of modular, reusable UI elements that can be quickly integrated into various web apps.
* Make sure the components adhere to accessibility standards and are visually pleasing and intuitive to use.
* Make sure the components are compatible with front-end frameworks like ReactJS, NextJS, Typescript and VueJS.

**Project Duration:** 350 hours

**Difficulty:** Medium



**Title:  Automatic Database pipeline CI/CD**

**Mentor(s):**  TBD

**Skills required/preferred:** CI/CD, YAML, Bash Script, Cloud Service ( AWS ), Docker

**Goal:**  Automating and streamlining the process of deploying database updates and changes is the aim of an Automatic Database pipeline CI/CD project. The main goal is to lessen the manual work required for deploying database changes and to lower the possibility of errors and downtime.

**Sub-Goal:**&#x20;

* Implement a CI/CD pipeline to deploy database updates and changes automatically.
* Automate and standardize the deployment process using YAML, Bash Script, and Docker&#x20;
* Make that the pipeline can manage complex database deployments and modifications and is safe, scalable, and flexible.

**Project Duration:** 170 hours

**Difficulty:** Easy



**Title:  Automatic Deployment  pipeline CI/CD**

**Mentor(s):**  TBD

**Skills required/preferred:** CI/CD, YAML, Bash Script, Cloud Service ( AWS ), Git, Docker

**Goal:**  The deployment procedure is to be automated and standardized by implementing a CI/CD pipeline. This entails that updates and modifications to applications can be released automatically, without the need for human participation, and in a regular and dependable manner. Git, Docker, YAML, Bash, and other potent technologies for automating and standardizing deployment procedures can all be used to construct the pipeline.

**Project Duration:** 170 hours

**Difficulty:** Easy



**Title:**  Netlify App automation pipeline&#x20;

**Mentor(s):**  TBD

**Skills required/preferred:** TypeScript, GitHub API, Docker, CI/CD, Bash Script, YAML

**Goal:**  Automating the deployment and management of Netlify apps to accommodate growth and changing needs and make it easier and faster to deploy changes and updates reducing the risk of downtime.

**Sub-Goal:**&#x20;

* Configure the pipeline using a CI/CD tool such as GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, or CircleCI. The pipeline should be configured to build, test, and deploy the app to Netlify.
* Write and test scripts in languages like Bash or YAML.
* Automate the build and deployment process by triggering the pipeline whenever changes are pushed to the Git repository. This should include running tests and checking the pipeline status.

**Project Duration:** 170 hours

**Difficulty:** Medium



**Title:**  Vercal App automation pipeline&#x20;

**Mentor(s):**  TBD

**Skills required/preferred:** TypeScript, GitHub API, Docker, CI/CD, Bash Script, YAML

**Goal:**  The development and deployment processes should be automated by the automation pipeline, which also makes sure that the most recent version of the programme is constantly deployed. The pipeline should contain monitoring and logging tools, continuous integration and deployment tools, and tools for keeping track of the performance of the app and identifying any problems that need to be fixed. The Vertical App should be able to handle growing traffic and demand given the pipeline's capabilities for autonomous scaling.

**Project Duration:** 170 hours

**Difficulty:** Medium



**Title:**  Github Page App automation pipeline&#x20;

**Mentor(s):**  TBD

**Skills required/preferred:** TypeScript, GitHub API, Docker, CI/CD, Bash Script, YAML

**Goal:**  The build and deployment processes should be automated by the automation pipeline, which interfaces with the Github Page App's code repository to guarantee that the most recent version of the app is always published to GitHub Pages. The pipeline should also include monitoring and logging tools to follow the performance of the app and find any problems that need fixing, as well as continuous integration and deployment tools.

**Sub-Goal:**&#x20;

* Integrate the Github Page App code with a version control system, such as Git, to manage the code and track changes.
* Choose a CI/CD tool such as CircleCI, TravisCI, or Jenkins, and configure it to integrate with the code repository.
* Create a script using a language such as TypeScript or Bash Script to automate the build process. The script should compile the code, run tests, and package the app for deployment.
* Use tools such as Docker or YAML to define and automate the deployment process. The deployment process should include steps to deploy the app to GitHub Pages and update the app with the latest changes.
* Use tools such as New Relic, LogRocket, or Sentry to monitor the app and log any errors or issues that arise during deployment.

**Project Duration:** 170 hours
