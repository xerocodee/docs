XeroCodee plans to apply as a Google Summer of Code mentoring organisation in 2023. We are thrilled to be a part of this 19-year-old initiative, which will bring in a new generation of open-source developers and enthusiasts.

Almost anybody [over 18](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/11/expanding-google-summer-of-code-in-2022.html) who enjoys coding and wants to learn more about the fantastic world of open source is welcome to join us as a GSoC 2023 contributor.
