# Contributor Code of Conduct

If you are a contributor interested in participating in the Google Summer of Code with the XeroCodee community, please visit the [GSOC idea list.](contribute-to-xerocodee/google-summer-of-code-2023/)

**What should you do before getting accepted:**

* Check out the program [website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
* Understand how the program [works](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works).
* Read the [contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) of the program.
* Make sure you are [eligible](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/terms/contributor) to participate in the program.
* Interact with the community using communication channels.
* Browse the idea list. The earlier, the better.

**Consider the following factors while selecting a project:**

1. You have met at least half of the prerequisites. The remaining abilities may be polished on the go, so don't be concerned if you lack any.
2. You can relate to the project concept and have utilised something relevant to it as a user.
3. You are more interested in gaining new abilities than in bragging about the ones you currently have

**Technical skills**

Experience building and implementing web applications, as well as managing end-to-end client and server-side development, is required. It is necessary to have knowledge of a prominent Javascript web framework (React.js, Next.js, Vue.js, Typescript, and so on). The selection of the UI library/tools is flexible and will be dependent on the mentor and mentee's agreement.
